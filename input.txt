The <b>EZGrip Pen Grips</b> allow the use of one fingertip instead of three fingers. The Pen Grip reduces grip forces needed to write and can be used on a pencil, pen, scalpel or any other pencil-like instrument. The ergonomic design of these Pen Grips gives you more control with minimal effort. <br><br> The unique design of this grip allows one finger to exert downward pressure for writing and no squeezing is necessary. The pen/pencil with the applied grip is held lightly without falling out or through the fingers. <br><br>  EZGrip Pen Grips are especially helpful to persons with arthritis, cramping/dystonia, Carpal Tunnel and any type of grip impairment or for just plain comfort. They are used for finger stress relief as well as prevention of cramping, or other difficulties. EZGrips are patented and have been awarded U.S. Utility and Design patents.	Helps prevent cramping, stress and injuries. 	Requires up to 57% less pressure than standard pens. 	Can be attached to any pencil, pen, scalpel or any other pencil-like instrument.

F	0	0	0		/members/270651/uploaded/ResQPenHndFgr341w.gif				Helps neutralizes hand difficulties due to arthritis immediately.	The design of the <b>EzGrip ResQ Gel Ergonomic Pen</b> allows writing to be comfortable and effortless. Using the ergonomic EzGrip® ResQ Gel Pen is a unique experience -- not only for its writing abilities – described as “…floating on paper,” but having the distinction as a pen that cradles and conforms to your extended finger and tip. Only the slightest touch of that one first finger tip is needed to provide downward writing pressure. Like touching a computer key – but lighter. The other fingers can just "go along for the ride." It’s not the usual everyday writing experience, but one more comfortable and advanced. <br><br> The gel ink is closest to fountain pen ink or roller ball in it's writing characteristics. It flows smoothly, and dries quickly. <br><br> By using the EzGrip ResQ Gel Pen, it’s possible to never again get writer’s cramp – never again contemplate the onset of any "Itis" – Tendonitis, Arthritis… or repetitive Stress Injuries (RSI’s) such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. In practical terms it also means that even having those conditions will not matter. Their mechanisms or weaknesses will not enter into the writing process. The EzGrip pen is often called the "miracle pen" for persons with arthritis, tendonitis, other hand problems or cramping. It neutralizes hand difficulties immediately. <br><br> Here’s How: Using the EzGrip ergonomic pen as described, the built-in mechanisms within our hands and arms that create those weaknesses are actually disconnected or bypassed. <br><br> The patented EzGrip enables the individual to switch positions, relying on other fingers. Many of us write in personal ways – with different finger holds. The EzGrip allows users to switch fingers at any time to adapt to their individual style of writing. More specifically, the side of the thumb can be used for downward writing pressure – even the middle finger knuckle. There is no incorrect way to hold and use an EzGrip. It’s your choice. And it's a choice that can save you pain and discomfort. <br><br> <b>Uses Parker style refills.</b>	Clinically tested ergonomic design.	EzGrip pen helps reduce writing fatigue.

The <b>BeasyTrans™ Transfer Slide System</b> provides users with a safe, comfortable and dignified way to transfer from bed to wheelchair, from wheelchair to commode or shower seat, to a car and back again. <br><br> BeasyTrans™ Systems are totally portable. With the BeasyTrans™ Systems, most users can achieve regular access to an automobile. For some, this may mean a greater quality of life. The visiting of friends and relatives may be resumed. Educational and cultural undertakings can be attended. The systems may even allow the user to live at home while receiving outpatient care, rather than living in a long term facility and even for travelling! <br><br> It's a well documented fact: lifting leads to injury. For example, patient movement tasks statistically place nursing personnel in the top percentile of the U.S. labor force for back injuries. At the same time, the person being lifted is at risk for arm and brachial plexus type injuries as well as back injuries from being torqued or twisted. The risk of such injuries is tremendously reduced when lifting is eliminated. The frictionless, lateral slide is clearly the state of the art in patient transfer. <br><br> The design of the BeasyTrans™ Easy Transfer Slides make it possible to apply sliding technology to a wide range of transfer and therapeutic functions in both the clinical and homecare environment.  <br><br> For example, strategic placement of the Beasy seat under a draw sheet allows a minimum number of caregivers to easily perform such difficult transfers as bed to gurney, supine, or boosting of patients. <br><br> Because the seat easily rotates 360 degrees, the systems can be used for range of motion exercises for hands, feet or other body parts.  <DIV ALIGN="Center"><TABLE BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="1" CELLSPACING="1" style="border: 1px solid #000000; margin-top: 1px;"><TR><th colspan="4">AVAILABLE BEASYTRANS™ MODELS</th> </TR><TR><th>Model</th><th>Description</th> <th>Dimensions</th><th>Weight</th></TR></TD><TR><TD><b>BeasyTrans™</b></TD><TD>Ideal for automobile transfers, for space-limited transfers and bed repositioning.</TD><TD>40"L x 12"W</TD><TD>6½lbs </TD></TR><br /> <TR><TD><b>BeasyGlyder™</b></TD><TD>Designed for situations when the wheelchair arm is not removable or there is an obstacle present.</TD> <TD>32"L x 10"W</TD><TD>4½lbs.</TD><br /> </TR><TR><TD><b>Beasy II™</b></TD> <TD>Ideal for smaller areas, such as transfers in the bathroom or for boosting in bed.</TD><TD>27½"L x 12"W</TD> <TD>4½lbs.</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV><br />  <a href="http://site.wrightstuff.biz/images/BeasyTrans_training-video.wmv" target="_blank">BeasyTrans Easy Transfer Board Training Video</a>	Frictionless, lateral slide allows for a smooth transfer.

FINALLY, A SLEEP AID THAT ADDRESSES COMFORT AND COMPLIANCE ISSUES FOR CPAP USERS. <br><br> The people at Contour Living have developed a solution. It’s the <b>CPAP Multi-Mask Sleep Aid Pillow</b>. <br><br> The American Sleep Apnea Association identifies CPAP therapy as the most common treatment for sleep apnea. CPAP therapy works by preventing the airway from closing during sleep. It is administered at bedtime through a nasal or facial mask held in place by velcro straps around the patient’s head. The mask is connected by a tube to a small air compressor. The CPAP machine sends air under pressure through the tube and into the mask, where it imparts positive pressure to the upper airways, preventing the tissues in the back of the throat from collapsing during sleep. <br><br> This is an extremely effective form of treatment when used in compliance with doctors orders. However, non-compliance is a big issue. It has been estimated that over 65% of patients use the machine for a maximum of just 4 hours per night when it should be used for the duration of the patient’s sleep. Additionally, many patients report using the CPAP for just a few nights out of the week. <br><br> Discomfort is a major factor contributing to non-compliance. During side sleeping or stomach sleeping, the mask presses and rubs against the patient’s face, which leads to discomfort and can also distort the mask, causing leaks and exacerbating the problem of non-compliance. <br><br> See the before CPAP Pillow and after CPAP Pillow pictures below.

The <b>Heelift® Petite Suspension Boot</b> is indicated for pediatric patients or for patients who are smaller than what is considered the average size for an adult. Specifically, Heelift® Petite works best for patients ranging in height from 3'10 to 5'4 and whose calf circumferences measure 6 to 10 inches. <br><br> Children, just like adults, are at risk for heel pressure ulcers if they are stationary for long periods of time due to health conditions or multi-hour surgery. Heelift Petite, together with turning and careful monitoring of the skin, can aid in preventing pressure ulcers in these young patients.	Shorter length proximal to the heel: To accommodate short patients, the length of Heelift Petite is shorter than Heelift Standard.	Extended Stitching: Located along the top rim, the added stitching narrows the forefoot and increases support to provide improved protection against foot drop, equines deformity, or heel cord contracture.	"Easy-on, easy-off" rounded straps and D-ring closures: Padded Velcro® straps are easy for the patient and/or healthcare professional to use and can easily be adjusted to accommodate specific patient needs.	Friction-free tricot backing: Unlike other suspension products, which can have sharp edges on the back that can rub against the patient's other leg, Heelift is manufactured with a smooth tricot backing that aids in patient mobility and helps ensure patient safety.	Smooth or Convoluted foam: Heelift Petite is available in either Smooth or Convoluted foam. Smooth foam is ideal for patients with edematous legs as it will not create "impressions" on the leg. Convoluted foam is slightly cooler to wear.	Ventilation holes: Ventilation holes provide additional air circulation to promote increased patient comfort.	Tricot covered stiffener: This feature prevents Heelift from buckling for added patient comfort and safety.	The Heelift features forefoot support using a spring back technology to keep the foot upright.	The Heelift can be autoclaved for sterilization.

CDM009079	Bariatric Heelift Suspension Boot	Helps prevent heel pressure ulcers in bariatric patients.	F	0	0	0		/members/270651/uploaded/heelift-bariatric.jpg				Helps prevent heel pressure ulcers in bariatric patients.	The <b>Heelift® Bariatric Suspension Boot</b> boasts all of the same qualities as Heelift Standard, but is designed specifically for bariatric patients (patients who weigh up to 600 pounds). Healthcare professionals are increasingly recognizing obesity as a risk factor for diabetes and associated complications, including heel pressure ulcers. <br><br> Heelift Bariatric Suspension Boot helps prevent heel pressure ulcers in patients who are particularly prone to suffer from the condition. Specifically, Heelift Bariatric was developed for patients weighing up to 600 pounds who have a calf circumference of between 12 to 23 inches. <br><br> Like Heelift Standard, Heelift Bariatric offloads the heel by redistributing pressure from the heel to the patient's calf. The design of Heelift Bariatric minimizes contact between the patient's leg and objects that can cause pressure at the heel or at folds in the skin. Rounded, adjustable straps and a smooth, friction-free tricot backing also ensure that the Heelift will not rub against or cause impressions on the patient's other leg. <br><br> Together with diligent care and monitoring, Heelift Bariatric can help even the most at-risk patients prevent heel pressure ulcers. 	Extended Stitching: Located along the top rim, the added stitching narrows the forefoot and increases support to provide improved protection against foot drop, equines deformity, or heel cord contracture.	"Easy-on, easy-off" rounded straps and D-ring closures: Padded Velcro® straps are easy for the patient and/or healthcare professional to use and can easily be adjusted to accommodate specific patient needs.

The <b>Video for Alzheimer's Patients</b> contains pictures of flowers along with music from the early 20th century brings back warm memories in a beautiful, relaxing format. <br><br> In the fall of 2007, my mom asked if I would help keep track of her checking account. She expressed a fear of making a serious financial mistake because she had been forgetting to write entries in her ledger. My mother had never missed a payment, successfully balancing her checkbook to her 80th year. But there she was, asking me for help. This thoroughly independent lady painfully relinquished control of her finances. <br><br> As time went on, she had to give up more and more control as she experienced a number of strokes and the onslaught of Alzheimer's. By the end of 2008, she could no longer live independently and moved into an assisted living facility. The doctors told her she had Alzheimer's/Dementia for a number of years, which was taking a toll on her health. She was in and out of hospitals five times in her last year. One of the hospitals provided a television channel with 24/7 videos and music. We watched for hours, and I quizzed her on the flowers and trees on the television. You see, I am a landscape designer with a background in horticulture. My mom got me interested in plants at a young age. She helped me get a job at a local nursery when I was 13 years old.    <br><br> One day in the hospital, I thought about using the thousands of flower photographs I have taken over the years to make a DVD video for persons with Alzheimer's and other dementia.   The pictures of flowers along with music from the early 20th Century bring back  warm memories in a beautiful, relaxing format. The video is 60 minutes long and has over 400 high-quality images of flowers. Some pictures include birds, bees or butterflies. The music consists of classics such as America The Beautiful, Shine On Harvest Moon, Just A Closer Walk, A Bicycle Built For Two, Amazing Grace, and God Be With You Till We Meet Again. <br><br> My mother lost her battle with Alzheimer's in June of 2009, but her legacy lives on through the video by helping others appreciate the beauty of God's creation. <br><br> <object width="480" height="295"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/h6LrR0t5AIU&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x006699&color2=0x54abd6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/h6LrR0t5AIU&hl=en_US&fs=1&color1=0x006699&color2=0x54abd6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="295"></embed></object>													Video:;60 minutes long.

It is designed to help people who have medical conditions in which they either partially or completely lose the ability to independently move their leg. Paraplegia, hemiplegia, paraparesis, hip surgery, and knee surgery are fairly common examples. <br><br> The foot loop stays open until the strap is pulled and then conforms to the shape of the foot for a secure and comfortable grip. Rigid middle section allows for easy maneuverability. Once pulled, the loop closes and conforms to the shape of the foot for a secure and comfortable fit.  This, combined with the rigid middle section" he asserts "makes it easier to place on the foot than other leg lifts and reduces the risk of the foot falling out and becoming injured. <br><br> <object width="392" height="238"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/oIBEjDu75Y8?fs=1&hl=en_US&rel=0&color1=0x006699&color2=0x54abd6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/oIBEjDu75Y8?fs=1&hl=en_US&rel=0&color1=0x006699&color2=0x54abd6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="392" height="238"></embed></object>	Foot loop conforms to the shape of the foot for a secure and comfortable grip.

But most importantly, the Toilet Riser™ won’t force you to change your bathroom experience. <br><br> There are no new tools to use. No extra parts. You’ll get to use the same toilet you’re familiar with. The Easy Toilet Riser™ just boosts it a little higher. <br><br> The Easy Toilet Riser™ comes in a kit with everything you need for easy installation. Although The Medway Corporation Easy Toilet Riser™ ships in an 11 lb. package, the toilet seat riser is made with sturdy and high quality PVC strong enough to support up to 500 lbs. <br><br> ***Non-returnable hygiene product***	You get to sit on your toilet — not on a plastic accessory on top of your toilet.	You don’t have an extra apparatus to clean between uses.	It’s a raised toilet seat that’s made in the USA.	Easily attaches to the floor.	Discreet design with low profile.

The <b>Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc</b> is designed for use by patients who are able to stand but cannot readily move their legs. For maximum support and safety for both the patient and the helper, we recommend that either a transfer belt or sling be used in conjunction with the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc. <br><br> An individual with impaired mobility from paralysis or limited upper body functions can use the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc unassisted in a very efficient way. If the patient cannot use his/her upper extremities a helper will be needed. <br><br> The <b>Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc</b> is placed on the floor with the label facing downwards. The patient's feet are to be positioned completely on the disc to facilitate a smooth transfer and reduce back strain on both patient and helper. The handle of the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc should be placed facing the patient, to prevent interfering with the feet of the helper. The helper should place one of his/her feet on the disc to safely monitor and control the transfer. After using the <b>Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc</b>, it should immediately be removed from the floor to avoid accidents. <br><br> Because of the lightweight and convenient grip handle, the Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc is easy to use and carry. The Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc is made of three high quality polymer plates, one turning on top of the other. The Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc is also equipped with anti-glide tapes on both sides to prevent slipping on the floor or when a patient is standing on the disc. <br><br> Transfer between a chair and a wheelchair: The disc is "locked" in place when the helper places his/her heel comfortably on the floor and the rest of his/her foot firmly on the plate between the feet of the patient. The patient wears a transfer belt and the helper holds on to the handles while guiding the patient through the transfer. <br><br> Transfer between a wheelchair and a toilet: Proper use of the disc in this situation is identical to above, except it is safer and easier with two helpers. The helper(s) can use their other, free hand(s) to help undress the patient before placing him/her on the toilet. Transfer between a wheelchair and a bed: Before you move a patient from a bed to a wheelchair, you should make sure that the wheelchair is positioned as close to the bed as possible, with the wheels locked. (For better control and safety, always have the patient wear a transfer belt. <br><br> Safety Sure Transfer Pivot Disc weighs 2 pounds and is 1/2 inch thick.

CNR023	SUNzyme - Discontinued	Environmentally safe and user friendly Odor Neutralizer.	T	0	0	0		/members/270651/uploaded/SUNzyme.jpg		N=Size:;C=2 ounce[I=*00]		Environmentally safe and user friendly Odor Neutralizer.	<b>SUNzyme</b> is a water based odor neutralizer consisting of a blend of natural oils which have been formulated and distilled. The ingredients used in its formulation have been used regularly in food flavors and have a long history of safety use. <br><br> <b>SUNzyme</b> neutralizes Malodors. Malodors themselves are very volatile and light within the atmosphere. As a result, the malodor permeates throughout the entire atmosphere, first, causing unpleasantness then coming into direct contact with the olfactory senses. When <b>SUNzyme</b> encounters malodors, either static or airborne, it combines with them in the atmosphere forming a neutral substance. Due to the high molecular weight of both the malodor and <b>SUNzyme</b>, they fall to a lower atmospheric level and biodegrade naturally. “Biodegradable” refers to the microorganisms in the environment which break down the SUNzyme. When <b>SUNzyme</b> and malodor fall to a lower atmospheric level, the microorganisms break down the encapsulated molecules. As a result of this biomolecular activity, normal air quality is restored. In many areas where <b>SUNzyme</b> is used continuously, a residual effect will impede the reoccurrence of the odor. <b>SUNzyme</b> may be sprayed into the air or directly onto surfaces. The surfactants in SUNzyme, by nature, are water soluble and biodegradable. <b>SUNzyme</b> can be diluted from a concentrated form and can be used as a process addition to existing products. <br><br> <b>SUNzyme</b> dispels the common misconception that industrial perfumes will contribute to eliminating odors. Industrial perfumes, otherwise known as masking agents, simply sit on odors and when the initial effect has worn off, the odor still exists and is even enhanced. The total odor level is increased to and overwhelming sensation which confuses the olfactory senses so it does not recognize the malodor. These masking agents are based on the premise that people perceive a mixture of smells as a single odor. They include compounds such as aromatics, alcohols, esters, aldehydes, ketones, and terpenes, all of which are dangerous to our well being. <br><br> <b>SUNzyme</b>, on the other hand, efficiently eliminates organic odors with organics. What actually cause the odor is organic matter decomposing. The typical odor causing molecule derives from oxygen, water, bacteria, and organic matter decomposing together. As a matter of decomposing, it emits gaseous odor. This is the unpleasant odor we smell. <br><br> <b>SUNzyme</b> is food grade approved, environmentally safe and user friendly, allowing the widest range of uses. The product will not contaminate the working environment even through misuse or the application equipment malfunction. <br><br> Odor Eliminator is available in 2 oz spray bottles.

The <b>Disabled Parking Placard Hanger's</b> J-hook design fastens safely and securely to the neck of your rear-view mirror. That area is not even visible from the driver’s seat, and it is the main reason why parking tags often tear during the process. Simply hang your placard on the J-hook and GO, it’s that easy! Fits ANY vehicle!  <br><br> Don’t you wish that parking tag of yours would just slip on and off your mirror as easy as a warm knife cuts butter? Well now, for less than the price of a coffee and donut, it can.  <br><br> Invented by a handicapped placard owner who became very frustrated every time he tried to hang his parking tag from the mirror, this ingenious product has made life a lot easier for many people.  <br><br> As you know, the mirror arm that these parking tags hang from cannot be seen from the driver’s seat. That means you have to lean forward, crank your head and neck and basically twist your body into positions it was never designed to be in just so you can see where to hang your tag.  <br><br> You know what I’m talking about. It’s a real pain in the ‘you know what’.  <br><br> Some folks are so bothered by the pain and struggle of hanging their placards, they just leave them up all the time. Maybe you know someone who drives around with their handicapped placard hanging off the mirror. Maybe you’ve even done it yourself.	Makes it easy to display and remove your placard.	No Need to Stretch, Twist or Struggle. Easy, simple, painless.	Designed to stay cool even in scorching hot interiors in the middle of the summer.

The <b>Psyche Sleep Pillow Extra-Large</b> was designed by a sleep apnea patient for the sleep apnea patient. Every detail has been designed to help the sleep apnea patient finally get a good night’s sleep. Constructed of new visco-elastic memory foam, it provides C-PAP users just the right amount of support for comfortable positioning. The unique butterfly shape gives proper support to the neck and shoulders whether you sleep on your side or on your back.  <br><br> The Psyche Sleep Pillow is protected with a removable quilted Cool-Max cover made from a special wicking material. This special material helps regulate your body’s temperature, keeping you dry and cool on warm nights, and warm and cozy on cool nights. Extra quilted Cool-Max covers are available and sold separately. To ensure long lasting quality, hand washing the removable cover is recommended. Across the top of the pillow are two sewn in elastic straps designed to take the weight of the tubing off the C-PAP mask, which allows the user to change positions easier.  <br><br> This is the best pillow I have ever used as a CPAP patient! It’s like having a Tempurpedic pillow, but custom-tailored for my CPAP mask. I found that I had proper neck support whether I slept on my side or on my back. I really like the elastic bands that allow the tubing to move with me as I change sleeping positions. The Cool-Max covering is also very comfortable. I also like the fact that this pillow is made in America. -Debbie S. , Baltimore, MD <br><br> SIMPLY AWESOME!!! Psyche has developed a true memory foam, side sleeper pillow.

Thanks to the input from hundreds of Speech-Language Pathologists & Occupational Therapists the final design of The <b>PROVALE®</b> Cup  is now available. <br><br> Simply by tipping this cup in a normal drinking motion, 5 cc or 10cc of liquid is delivered.

Today is Tuesday, you have had a good breakfast and taken all of your medication.  Mary is here with you, and I will be back this afternoon."
